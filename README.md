# Holiday_Sales_Forecasting

A Machine Learning project on a retail dataset sourced from Kaggle to optimize holiday sales strategy by forecasting markdown effects using Linear Regression and Neural Network models such as (a)Artificial Neural Networks with Backpropagation and (b)Long Short-Term Memory models.

A custom forecasting function that calculates the sensitivity of holiday sales to changes in various departmental activities within a selected store which provides valuable insights for optimizing promotional strategies for individual departments was also designed as part of the project.
